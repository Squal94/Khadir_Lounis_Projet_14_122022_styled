## 1. General information

You work for the technology department of a major financial company, WealthHealth.

This company uses an internal web application called HRnet, which manages employee files.  
The application is old and uses jQuery side front end, resulting in considerable bugs and  
an increase in internal complaints.
Your development team want to migrate jquery to react application.

## 2. Convert jquery component to react component

I chose to convert the component select, you can find the repository
and the operating documents on this repository :

[React Component npm package](https://github.com/Squal94/Khadir_Lounis_Projet_14_122022_LibrarySelectv2.git)

## 3.Install packages and library for this application

For different libraries you must :

    1. install project with npm  :

    `npm install `

    2. libary use for the project :

    [@squal94/selectcomponent14v7 "^1.0.0"] (https://github.com/Squal94/Khadir_Lounis_Projet_14_122022_LibrarySelectv2.git)
    - react "^18.2.0"

      This is all the package and library use for the proper operation of this project.
